# Binary Filtering and Analysis
 This repository is dedicated to a final project for Texas A&M University's reverse engineering course.
 It contains extensive research sources and compiled information on static and dynamic binary filtering methods,
 especially as it pertains to malware detection, identification, obfuscation and packaging. In addition, there is an overview of a variety of filtering tools, both in development and commercial, and the methods used to analyze compiled
 binary files and extract vital information.
